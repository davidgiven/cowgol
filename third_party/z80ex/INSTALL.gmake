Building with GNU toolset:
--------------------------------------------------------

NB: Only GNU C (GCC, mingw, cygwin) is supported by the included Makefile

Issue 'gmake' in the root of Z80Ex source tree. 
After a successful build the libraries could be found in "./lib".

Alternatively you may do "gmake static" for building static libs only,
or "gmake shared" for building shared libs only.

You may change some build options by editing the Makefile or via
gmake command line parameters (e.g. "gmake parameter=value")
these are:
* ENDIANNESS -- CPU endianness, one of WORDS_LITTLE_ENDIAN, WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN
* OPSTEP_FAST_AND_ROUGH -- fast and rough opcode step emulation mode (0 - off, 1 - on)
	when this mode is on, timings of internal I/O operations are ignored,
	and tstate callback feature is disabled
* INSTALL_PREFIX -- where to install the library
* TOOLS_PREFIX -- useful for cross-compiling, e.g., when cross-compiling to mingw32
	it should be set to something like "i586-mingw32msvc-" so "i586-mingw32msvc-gcc"
	and "i586-mingw32msvc-ar" will be used instead of regular "gcc" and "ar". 

Installing:
--------------------------

issue "gmake install" as superuser.
(default install prefix is /usr/local, which may be changed in Makefile.)
then do "/sbin/ldconfig" as superuser to update DSO links and cache
